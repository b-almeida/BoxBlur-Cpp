# Box Blur
A tool to blur PNG images using a box blur algorithm. Developed in Code::Blocks on Windows for Grade 11 Computer Science.

This repository contains two versions of the project. The basic version uses a fixed blur radius of 1, while the advanced version uses an adjustable blur radius (set in `main.cpp`).

The project uses a sample image (`apple.png`) and outputs the result to a new image (`blurred.png`). You can change these file names in `main.cpp`.
